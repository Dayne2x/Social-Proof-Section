## My process

### Built with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

In this project I used the "transform" property for the first time in order to align elements to specification. I am not completely satisified with the result and will rewrite the code in order to make it resemble the required solution more closely. Also the mobile version is not yet complete.


### Continued development

In addition to HTML and CSS, I have also starded learning JavaScript in order to start building more dynamic and challenging projects.
