## My process

### Built with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid


### What I learned

In this project I used the "transform" property for the first time in order to align elements to specification as well. I created an additional stylesheet in order for the media queries in order to keep the code more readable.


### Continued development

In addition to HTML and CSS, I have also starded learning JavaScript in order to start building more dynamic and challenging projects.
